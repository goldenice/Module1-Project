Eca - Event Condition Action
=================================

Eca is an educational tool aimed at allowing students to quickly prototype
rules for handling events. The basis of Neca is a rules system that reacts to
externally generated events.

The architecture favours simplicity over robustness. Multithreading is used in
favour of more suitable parallelism options such as greenlets to keep
dependencies to a minimum for ease of deployment.

This program is not intended for production use. It may contain security issues
not tolerable outside of a controlled environment.

Eca requires Python 3.2 or higher.
